### Blake2b256

Blake2b256 is a specific type of hash function known for its speed and security. It takes any input data and generates a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value. The blake2b part refers to the specific design of the algorithm, and the 256 indicates the length of the resulting hash code. Blake2b256 is widely used in cryptographic applications, blockchain technologies, and secure data storage.
